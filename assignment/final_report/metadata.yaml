  Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks are currently a popular topic
  of research, leading to works that attempt to build models that can be used
  in the world, instead of just being used in research. Nevertheless, there are
  works that focuses on this but doesn't achieve a good performance, due to the
  use of inefficient architectures or not applying techniques to improve the
  training and reduce the resources used. In this work we will increase the
  accuracy of our baseline model, by using newer architectures and by the use
  of new techniques such as Mixed-Precision training, Mixup and Transfer
  Learning. The result of this work were four new models that not only trained
  in fewer amount of epochs, but also achieve higher accuracy than our baseline.
