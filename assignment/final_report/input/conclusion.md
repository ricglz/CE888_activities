This paper developed four models that showed the necessity that exists of using efficient techniques and architectures to be able to not only obtain a model good a good performance, but also to be able to achieve them with less resources. By doing this it allows the researchers or other developers to implement these models in IoT devices, as the response will be faster than with models that demand more resources to operate. It could even allow the developers to add the software directly to the devices themselves, because based on the information in table \ref{tab:time} we can assume that the inference time of must of the models, with the exception of EfficientNet, is faster than needed.

Nevertheless, there are still factors that could improve the performance of the models, starting with having a more diverse dataset, as we consider that one problem with the datasets is that the repetition of the same frames due to being extracted from videos, may cause that the model can't learn to generalize quickly enough to recognize when there is and when there's not fire in the image. In addition that basically this create the illusion that our dataset may be big enough, able to generalize the information, while the reality may be that there are not enough samples of all the environments.

As another next step would be, that now that we know that these techniques help in the creation of better models, we should replicate the procedure for architectures that were designed for mobile devices or those devices with limited resources. Architectures such as: MobileNet \cite{howard2019}, FBNet \cite{wu2019} and pruned versions of the less complex versions of EfficientNet \cite{tan2020}.
