## Model

For this paper we will experiment with different architectures as the backbone of our model. Taking in consideration that \cite{shamsoshoara2020} used the Xception \cite{chollet2017} architecture as the backbone of their model, which could be considered as an old architecture it is important to look for newer models which are more efficient in terms of time of inference, training and amount of parameters.

These conditions reduced the experimentation to the next architectures: EfficientNet \cite{tan2020}, ReXNet \cite{han2020}, GENet \cite{lin2020} and RepVGG \cite{ding2021}.
