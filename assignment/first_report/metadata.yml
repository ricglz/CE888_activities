  In this paper it will be explored the idea if it's
  possible to improve the accuracy of the FLAME model,
  capable of fire detection; by using modern
  architectures and adding more diversity to the dataset
  by adding new images and augmenting the current ones.

  This resulted in not yet achieving the desired accuracy,
  but showing potential, considering the possible reduce
  of computational resources and the overall small amount
  of parameters of the trained model
