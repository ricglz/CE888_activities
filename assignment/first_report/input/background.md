# Background / Literature Review

## Convolutional Neural Network

<!-- Background information expands upon the key points stated in your introduction but is not the main focus of the paper. Sufficient background information helps your reader determine if you have a basic understanding of the research problem being investigated and promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and findings. -->

<!-- Background information can also include summaries of important, relevant research studies. The key is to summarize for the reader what is known about the specific research problem before you conducted your analysis. This is accomplished with a general review of the foundational research literature (with citations) that report findings that inform your study's aims and objectives. -->

Are a type of Neural Networks commonly used for the areas of Image Recognition and Computer Vision, this type of networks have the main feature of being divided in several deeply connected _convolutional_ and _pooling_ layers, to finally end with a _classifier_ which is a fully connected layer comparable to a layer of traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
