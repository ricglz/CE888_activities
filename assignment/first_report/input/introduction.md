\IEEEPARstart{W}{ild} fires currently are on of the must dangerous natural disasters that are threating the world. According to an investigation done by the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the emissions produced by the wildfires often lead to harmful pollution not only in the area near the wildfire but also can extent even farther from the area, harming humans and other specials alike \cite{NOAA}.

In addition to that, there are ecosystems which fauna and flora are being threatened due to the fires and to human intervention. Being that the case of the Amazon Rainforest, where the mentioned causes alongside droughts, could led to a possible "tipping point" where the Rainforest would be unsustainable in the case that there's no effective intervention of the matter \cite{Malhi}.
